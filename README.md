# Zenix

Zenix is a hobby Operating System fully written in Rust from scratch. The main goal of the project is to experiment with alternative designs of how an Operating System might function. Read the [Introduction](./wiki/introduction.md) for more information on how Zenix compares to Unix. Another goal is to provide information and practical examples on how to write your own Operating System. Documentation is available on the [Wiki](./wiki/README.md).
